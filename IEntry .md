**Prepare Configuration Information**
Before you create a project, collect the information that Xcode needs to identify your app and you as a developer:

**Product name**. The name of your app as it will appear in the App Store and appear on a device when installed. The product name must be at least 2 characters and no more than 255 bytes, and should be similar to the app name that you enter later in App Store Connect.

**Organization identifier**. A reverse DNS string that uniquely identifies your organization. If you don’t have a company identifier, use com.example. followed by your organization name, and replace it before you distribute your app.

**Organization name**. The name that appears in boilerplate text throughout your project folder. For example, the source and header file copyright strings contain the organization name. The organization name in your project isn’t the same as the organization name that appears in the App Store
